## Engine Rules

In front of every entrance in the game the sphinx asks seven questions in a row. No pause. No delay. Rhythm.
There is a pool of 12 questions.
The questions fit to the entrance they are made for.
Order is random.
The answers appear before the question.
Every question has four different answers, of which one is true.
Time to answer a question varies from 3 sec in the lowest level to 1/3 sec in the highest
The Sphinx disappears after the frist wrong answer. Her tableau is blocked.
Before the first sequence there is an action part, where the sphinx throws or shots something to the player (Seraph, The Matrix: "You don't know someone until you fight him")


## Visual Ideas

The sphinx appears on sphinx tableaus, square 5 by 5 meters.
Such tableaus you find in front of any entrance in the game.
Sometimes you can just walk over them, sometimes surprisingly the sphinx comes
Questions of the sphinx appear in extra large letters, moving, threatening colors, theatrical style


## Acoustic Ideas 

Medium speed techno/drums rhythm, dramatizing, horror
